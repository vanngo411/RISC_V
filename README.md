# RISC-V-CPU
A single cycle MIPS RISC-V CPU Core using Verilog

## Abstract
RISC-V is an open source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). In this project I have implemented a 32-bit, RISC-V ISA based processor in verilog and verified execution of instructions in RISC-V ISA. The sub-modules that are used and their interaction with each other are shown in the following picture.
